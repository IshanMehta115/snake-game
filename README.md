A classic snake game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right.
- The snake grows in length each time it eats the randomly placed food.
- Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or with the boundaries, as it will result in game over.
